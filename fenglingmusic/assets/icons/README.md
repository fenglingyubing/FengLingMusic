# Tray Icon Asset

This directory should contain the Windows system tray icon.

## Required File
- `tray_icon.ico` - Windows ICO format icon file (16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels)

## Icon Design Guidelines
1. Simple and recognizable design
2. Clear at small sizes (16x16 is most common for system tray)
3. Matches the FengLing Music brand
4. Both light and dark theme compatible if possible

## Alternative
If you don't have an ICO file, you can convert a PNG to ICO using online tools or:
- Windows: Use Paint or dedicated ICO conversion tools
- Cross-platform: Use GIMP or ImageMagick

## Temporary Placeholder
For development, you can use Flutter's default icon or create a simple colored square.

Note: The actual icon file should be created by a designer and placed in this directory.
